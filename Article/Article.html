<h1><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>In this article we will explore the idea of Servless computing via the use of 
Azure Functions which I will wire up to a Azure Event Grid custom event to do 
some work. The demo itself is nothing special but by the end of this article I 
would hope you would be able to craft your own events, and understand what could 
be done with Azure Functions.</p>

<h2><a name="The-promise-of-serverless-computing" id="The-promise-of-serverless-computing">The promise of serverless computing</a></h2>
<p><br><em>What if you could spend all your time building and deploying great 
apps, and none of your time managing servers? Serverless computing lets you do 
just that because the infrastructure you need to run and scale your apps is 
managed for you. Focus your efforts on your business. Redirect resources from 
infrastructure management into innovating and bringing apps to market faster.<br>
<br><br>Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure and 
operating systems. When you build serverless apps you don�t need to provision 
and manage any servers, so you can take your mind off infrastructure concerns. 
Serverless computing is driven by the reaction to events and triggers happening 
in near-real time in the cloud. As a fully managed service, server management 
and capacity planning are invisible to the developer and billing is based just 
on resources consumed or the actual time your code is running.</em></p>

<h1><a name="Why-Azure-Functions?" id="Why-Azure-Functions?">Why Azure Functions?</a></h1>
<p><em>Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or 
&quot;functions,&quot; in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem 
at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run 
it.</em></p>
<p><em>

</em>up on date : 06/12/17</p>
<p>Azure functions come with quite a few hooks to various other services in 
Azure, for example there is support for these servies that could trigger your 
Azure Function code:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Azure Cosmos DB</li>
	<li>Azure Event Hubs</li>
	<li>Azure Event Grid</li>
	<li>Azure Mobile Apps (tables)</li>
	<li>Azure Notification Hubs</li>
	<li>Azure Service Bus (queues and topics)</li>
	<li>Azure Storage (blob, queues, and tables)</li>
	<li>GitHub (webhooks)</li>
	<li>On-premises (using Service Bus)</li>
	<li>Twilio (SMS messages)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Reactive-Programming" id="Reactive-Programming">Reactive Programming</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a massive fan of Rx and reactive programming as a whole, and for me 
Azure Functions also allow that type of react mindset. You send out an event, 
and the Azure function subscribes and does something when the event occurs. This 
is very easy to reason about, and you can have many isolated/self contained 
functions all doing their own little bit of the puzzle, all backed up by the 
Azure platform for scalability</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="Why-EventGrid?" id="Why-EventGrid?">Why EventGrid?</a></h1>
<p>The EventGrid is the new kid on the block (at time of writing anyway), and 
this is what Microsoft have to say about it on the home page for EventGrid
<strong>&quot;Build reactive, event-driven apps with a fully managed event routing 
service. Create richer app scenarios by connecting serverless logic to events 
from multiple sources.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>So why should we use him and not some of the already existing messaging 
systems like ServiceBus/EventHub?</p>
<p>I stumbled apon a great post that goes through exactly that, which I am going 
to extract from and reference here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Azure Service Bus</em></strong></p>
<p><em>When you have a shopping cart, when you�re buying stuff, and when you�re 
moving money or material you would probably use Azure Service Bus because you 
want transactions, you want instantaneous consistency, you want to be able to 
have temporal control like if this is not processed in x amount of minutes then 
dead letter it or send it somewhere else for an escalation. When you want these 
kinds of orchestrated (workflow) stuff to do state transitions then you�ll be 
using Azure Service Bus. It�s really like IBM MQ or BizTalk Server, however at 
cloud scale. In a nutshell, when you need robustness and cannot afford to lose 
any messages, you�ll go for Azure Service Bus.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Azure Event Grid</strong></em></p>
<p><em>When you�re actually shipping and moving stuff, where you are reacting to 
things like item has been pulled from the shelf, item was bought to postal area, 
item has been shipped, or this shipment was rejected and so on, in this case 
instead of doing a central control workflow you would do in an Event based model 
running active workflows for each product item. Here you are reacting to real 
changes in real time. Azure Event Grid is ideal for these kinds of reactive 
scenarios. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Azure Event Hub</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Azure Event Hub is used more for the telemetry scenarios. Let�s say if 
every component that�s been used in the Enterprise for this e-commerce 
application emits telemetry data like Log4Net or Log4J and you wanted to capture 
it, then you�ll use Azure Event Hub. A great example is Azure Application 
Insight, under the hood it uses Azure Event Hub to capture the telemetry 
information.<br><br>Hope this helps to clarify the need for 3 different 
messaging platforms in Microsoft Azure and when to use them appropriately. </em>

<h1><a name="The-Demo" id="The-Demo">The Demo</a></h1>
<p>Ok so now enough of the theory, what are we going to demo. Well its actually 
fairly simple, we will provision a new EventGrid in Azure, and then create a 
Azure Function subscriber who will react to a custom event that a Console 
Application will send from on premise to the Auzre hosted EventGrid.</p>
<p>That's it. Oh but we would like to be able to debug the local Console 
Application and the Azure function locally using Visual Studio before we publish 
the Azure Function to Azure.</p>
<p>Simply requirements I am sure you will agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Provisioning-An-EventGrid" id="Provisioning-An-EventGrid">Provisioning An EventGrid</a></h2>
<p>Before we can do anything we need an actual <code>EventGrid </code>in Azure, 
so you will need an <strong>ACTIVE</strong> Azure account. If you have one of 
these its simply a matter of using the portal to create a new <code>EventGrid topic</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="create1Big.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="253" src="create1Small.png" width="600"></a></p>
<p><em>CLICK FOR BIGGER IMAGE</em></p>
<p>This will take a while to provision. But when it finally is provisioned you 
should see something like this in the portal.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="30" src="create2Small.png" width="600"></p>
<p>If you click this one of the things you can add <strong>Event Subscription</strong>. 
Which allows you to wire up the <code>EventGrid </code>to other components that will react to 
the messages pumped through the <code>EventGrid </code></p>
<p><img alt="" height="349" src="create3Small.png" width="600"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will come back to this <strong>Event Subscription </strong>area when we 
look at the Azure function in a minute</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="EventGrid-Messages" id="EventGrid-Messages">EventGrid Messages</a></h2>
<p>When using the Azure EventGrid you can't just push out any old payload there 
is a set schema for the messages, which you can read about here</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the schema </p>
<p><img alt="" height="359" src="eventProps.png" width="600"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So does that mean we can't send our own data?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No not at all, you simply have to ensure that the overall message schema 
adheres to that specified above. Your custom data would do in the <code>data</code>field.</p>
<p>Here is the message for this demo app that is used by both the Azure <code>EventGrid </code>and the Azure <code>Function</code>.</p>
<pre lang="cs">
//generic wrapper for Azure EventGrid custom event
public class CustomEvent&lt;T&gt;
{

    public string Id { get; private set; }

    public string EventType { get; set; }

    public string Subject { get; set; }

    public string EventTime { get; private set; }

    public T Data { get; set; }

    public CustomEvent()
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

        DateTime localTime = DateTime.Now;
        DateTime utcTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
        DateTimeOffset localTimeAndOffset = 
        	new DateTimeOffset(localTime, TimeZoneInfo.Local.GetUtcOffset(localTime));
        EventTime = localTimeAndOffset.ToString("o");
    }
}

//This is the data that will end up in the "data" field of the CustomEvent in this small demo
public class Account
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Gender { get; set; }
}
	
</pre>
<p>This is also a pretty important bit of information</p>
<div style="border:medium black solid; background-color:yellow">
<p style="margin:5px">
Events are sent to Azure Event Grid in an array, which can contain multiple event objects. If there is only a single event, the array has a length of 1. The array can have a total size of up to 1 MB. Each event in the array is limited to 64 KB.
</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="The-Console-Publisher" id="The-Console-Publisher">The Console Publisher</a></h2>
<p>Ok so now we know how to provision an <code>EventGrid </code>and we know what 
the messages look like, how do we send messages to the <code>EventGrid </code>we 
have provisioned?</p>
<p>Well that part is actually very easy we can use a simple Console Application 
(or whatever you like), and just make sure you have a Nuget/hard reference to
<code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> (or you own favourite JSON library)</p>
<p>We can then simply use code like this</p>
<pre lang="cs">
using Msft.Event.Core;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

{

    class Program
    {

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            {
                var eventNew = MakeRequestEvent();
                eventNew.Wait();
                Console.WriteLine(eventNew.Result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; MakeRequestEvent()
        {
            string endpoint = "https://YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE.westus2-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events";
            var httpClient = new HttpClient();
            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("aeg-sas-key", "YOUR_KEY_HERE");

            List&lt;CustomEvent&lt;Account&gt;&gt; events = new List&lt;CustomEvent&lt;Account&gt;&gt;();

            var customEvent = new CustomEvent&lt;Account&gt;();
            customEvent.EventType = "TestType";

            customEvent.Subject = "Test";
            customEvent.Data = new Account() { Name = "Maik", Gender = "Male" };

            events.Add(customEvent);
            string jsonContent = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(events);

            Console.WriteLine(jsonContent);

            var content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

            return await httpClient.PostAsync(endpoint, content);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Where you would need to find the following values from your own Azure <code>EventGrid</code> using the portal</p>
<ul>
	<li>endpoint</li>
	<li>key</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be found in the <code>EventGrid </code>blade in the portal</p>

<h2><a name="The-Function" id="The-Function">The Function</a></h2>
<p>So now onto the Azure Function. This is also fairly straight forward, we 
simply create a new Azure Functions project in Visual Studio (if you don't see 
this you may have to run the Visual Studio Installer and make sure you have the 
Azure wokflow element selected)</p>
<p><img alt="" height="318" src="func1.png" width="600"></p>
<p>So once you have a new Azure Functions project, you can add a new Azure 
Function to it by right clicking the project and choosing add new item as shown 
below</p>
<p><img alt="" height="126" src="func2.png" width="508"></p>
<p>When you are asked choose the following options</p>
<ul>
	<li>Http Triggered</li>
	<li>Anonymous Access</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you should see this starter code</p>
<pre lang="cs">

        {

            // parse query parameter
            string name = req.GetQueryNameValuePairs()
                .FirstOrDefault(q =&gt; string.Compare(q.Key, "name", true) == 0)
                .Value;

            // Get request body
            dynamic data = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync&lt;object&gt;();

            // Set name to query string or body data
            name = name ?? data?.name;

            return name == null
                ? req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body")

        }
    }
}

<p>Which is a fine place to start, but we want to get our function to talk to

            dynamic eventGridSoleItem = (payloadFromEventGrid as JArray)?.SingleOrDefault();

            {

        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Now there is a fair bit more going on there, what is all that?</p>
<p>Well this is due to how the subscription between the <code>EventGrid </code>
and Azure <code>Function </code>need to work together. Your Function needs to 
properly handle the <code>SubscriptionValidationEvent </code>sent out by Event 
Grid when a subscription endpoint is created. You can read more about this
<a href="create3Big.png" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>In fact I did not come up with this, when I was finding out how to do this, I 
came across this great post by one of the chaps at Microsoft that got me most of 
the way there :
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brandonh/2017/11/30/locally-debugging-an-azure-function-triggered-by-azure-event-grid/">
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brandonh/2017/11/30/locally-debugging-an-azure-function-triggered-by-azure-event-grid/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Testing-The-Function-Locally" id="Testing-The-Function-Locally">Testing The Function Locally</a></h2>
<p>So now we have all the peices to the puzzle we want to test it out right? So 
lets think about that we have a local Console Application publishing events to 
an Azure hosted <code>EventGrid</code>, and we want to use a local Azure 
Function inside Visual Studio to subscribe to events from the Azure hosted <code>EventGrid</code>. So how will that work?</p>
<p>Luckily on the post I link to above Brandon talks about a neat tool called 
<strong>ngrok</strong> which allows a TCP tunnel to be opened up and gives you a nice endpoint 
uri that you can then use to set in the Azure portal for the <code>EventGrid</code>subscription pointing to the local Azure Function for testing purposes.</p>
<p>When launching ngrok, you have the option of specifying the port it forwards 
to locally. For .Net Azure Functions this is, by default, <strong>7071</strong> 
so you need to give that to <strong>ngrok</strong> when you run it</p>
<p>This is all you need to run (in a command/PowerShell window) once you have 
installed <strong>ngrok</strong></p>
<pre>
ngrok http -host-header=localhost 7071
</pre>
<p>But be careful</p>
<div style="border:medium black solid; background-color:yellow">
<p style="margin:5px">
The <strong>ngrok</strong> command you run is session based, when the command window you used to run the 
<strong>ngrok</strong> command dies so does that endpoint, and you will need to 
run the command again, and update the Azure portal <code>EventGrid</code> subscription to the new 
<strong>HTTPS</strong> uri if you close the command window.</p>
	<p style="margin:5px">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin:5px">
	Don't forget to have your function running locally when you create the 
	subscription, as this is needed to get the correct 200 OK back with the 
	right payload, otherwise the EventGrid will error out and will fail to 
	create the subscription for you and you'll have to do it again.</p></div>
<p>With all that in place ALL you now need to do is enter the correct endpoint 
(the <strong>HTTPS</strong> one from the <strong>ngrok</strong> command line) 
information into the Azure EventGrid subscriptions area</p>
<a href="subsBig.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" height="449" src="subsSmal.png" width="600"></a>
<p><em>CLICK FOR BIGGER IMAGE</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok now with all that in place you should be able to run the following from 
the demo project together</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Msft.Azure.Function</li>
	<li>Msft.Event.Console</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that should just work</p>
<p>One final note is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Moving-To-Azure" id="Moving-To-Azure">Moving To Azure</a></h2>
<p>To <strong>publish</strong> the Azure function from Visual Studio you will 
need an <strong>ACTIVE</strong> Azure account. Once you have that setup in

pick the Azure Function project, right click it and choose the <strong>Publish</strong> 
menu</p>
<p><img alt="" height="232" src="publish.png" width="600"></p>

<p>Once this has successfully published to Azure you will need to get the 
endpoint for the function, and update the subscription associated with <code>EventGrid </code>such that the <strong>REAL</strong> cloud based <strong>Azure 
Function</strong> is called for any new event pumped out through the <code>EventGrid</code>. You would grab the endpoint of the <strong>Azure Function App</strong>, and then 
go and update the EventGrid subscription in much the same way you did above for 
a localhost test, but you would now use the real address that you got from the 
Azure portal for the <strong>Azure Function App</strong></p>

<p>I quite like using Azure functions for small discrete bits of work, I would 
not use them everywhere, in fact we don't anywhere we need long running workers, 
we are leaning towards the Azure Service Fabric for that type of thing. However 
you simply can't overlook just how easy it is to use Azure Functions, and just 
how many hooks there are to support them.</p>
<p>They are worth consideration in any fture architecture you look at if you are 
using Azure.</p>
